title: Day 07457 - Null
date: 2016-08-31

I'm actually writing this post on Sunday, 4th September, and as far as I can recall, I did absolutely *nothing* significant this day.

---

I played from 10 in the morning to 8 in the night. DotA, Dirty Bomb, and Age of Empires.

I spent some time making something remotely creative.. continued on the next entry because tomorrow (i.e tonight at 12) is something special.
