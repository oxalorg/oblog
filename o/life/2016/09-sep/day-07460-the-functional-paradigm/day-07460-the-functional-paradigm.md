title: Day 07460 - The functional paradigm
date: 2016-09-03

As I can see from my previous entires, the past few days, rather almost the entire week, has been a complete waste. I don't think I'd even realise it if I just forgot all the memories of the past 7 days. The only thing I'll miss is probably my mom's birthday.

So, today morning I read a lot about functional paradigm of programming. Saw a couple of talks, read quite a few articles, and have finally decided to start learning Haskell (directly borrowed from [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/getting-started-with-haskell) great SO post) from [learn you a haskell](learnyouahaskell.com), [happy learn haskell](http://www.happylearnhaskelltutorial.com/), and eventually move on to [real world haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/). I'll also obviously be trying to write actual code, maybe even try my hand at competitive programming or sites like Project Euler with it.

After spending the better half of my day on it, I decided to end it with DotA (typical).

Oh, and I also ate corn today:
