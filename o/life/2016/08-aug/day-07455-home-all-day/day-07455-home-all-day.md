title: Day 07455 - Home all day
date: 2016-08-29

Today I was at home all day. Played a little bit of DotA, Age of Empires, and Dirty Bomb. Watched a little youtube, mainly Ethan and Hila (from h3h3productions).

Apart from that I cleaned up my entire room, and got rid of most of the junk. There's still a bit of stuff left to do, which I'll finish tomorrow.

I wrote an elaborate blog post about the backlog and the junk which has holding me back: *[Eliminate your variables](/o/blog/eliminating-variables/)*.

Also a small video I took while cleaning:
